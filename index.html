					The general goal of the project is to address the challenges posed by the refugee dynamic in Europe, specifically in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. The project aims to leverage digital platforms and their principles to improve the coordination and orchestration of relevant stakeholders in crisis situations, with a particular focus on the Ukraine crisis. By developing an orchestration framework, the project seeks to transform the public administration into a platform where various actors, including public administrations, NGOs, private companies, schools, refugees, and volunteers, can collaborate and contribute to the co-creation of better public services. The ultimate objective is to provide reliable information and services to refugees and individuals in precarious situations while consolidating the engagement of civil society and the private sector with the resources of the state.

				Government as a Platform</div></div>
		<div class="grid-item grid_two_column dropdown_content add_padding lauftext">
					The concept of "Government as a Platform" (GaaP) plays a pivotal role in the project. GaaP refers to the transformation of the public sector into an open platform that fosters innovation and collaboration among internal and external actors to enhance public services. In the context of the Canton of Zurich, adopting the principles of GaaP allows for the platformization of public administration, enabling better coordination and cooperation between different stakeholders. By embracing digital platforms and leveraging their capabilities, the cantonal public administration can harness the expertise, resources, and innovation potential of various actors, leading to more efficient and resilient state organizations. The orchestration framework developed in the project aims to facilitate the implementation of GaaP principles, thereby improving the overall response to the Ukraine crisis and other emergency situations.

			R2G – Refugees to Government</div></div>
		<div class="grid-item grid_two_column dropdown_content add_padding lauftext">
					One significant contribution of the project is the development of R2G (Refugees to Government). R2G utilizes modern applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze large text corpora linked to refugee needs, enabling a bottom-up approach to refugee management. By utilizing state-of-the-art topic modeling techniques, R2G identifies and extracts relevant information from Telegram data to understand the current needs of the refugee population. This data-driven governance approach complements traditional top-down management strategies by integrating the knowledge and needs of refugees into policy and decision-making processes. The R2G publication showcases the potential of NLP and topic modeling in designing effective refugee management applications. The evaluation of R2G through a dedicated workshop involving stakeholders from the public sector and civil society contributes to the ongoing discourse on enhancing refugee management and demonstrates the value of data-driven approaches during refugee crises.

		<p>In March, Liudmila Zavolokina and Cédric Merz (Ergon AG) had a chance to present their work "Resilience in times of crisis - electronic identities for refugees from Ukraine" at the monthly E-ID Participation meeting of Bundesamt für Justiz BJ.</p>	  
	    <p>Currently, in Switzerland a work on the e-ID project is underway, which aims to establish a system of state-recognised, electronic credentials (e-ID) and introduce the associated legislation. The self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach is being pursued. This allows decentralised data storage at the individual user's premises. The data is only stored on your mobile device and it is up to you to decide what data you transmit to whom. As part of this initiative monthly participation meetings are held as a video conference. In the meetings, the current status of the e-ID project is presented and usually external experts to present e-ID-relevant topics. </p>
		<p>In their presentation, Liudmila Zavolokina and Cédric Merz showcased how SSI technology could be utilised for early identification of refugees in Switzerland and improve data exchange between private individual and public administration officies. Their research was carried out within the "Goverment as a Platform" project funded by DIZH</p>

		<p>Late August “Government as a Platform” research group has held a presentation of a pilot project on the potential usage of SSI technology for issue of digital IDs for the refugees in Switzerland. The results were presented to the practice partners from the Swiss software companies Ergon AG and Procivis as well as to the representative from the canton of Zurich and our colleagues from ZHAW. The presentation took place in UZH. The follow-up steps for the usage of SSI technology within the “Government as a Platform” project as well as in Switzerland in general were discussed. The importance and potential of the proposed topic was shared between the participants, and it was agreed that the further research in the field is needed in collaboration between technology providers, governmental organizations and research initiatives in order to work out a suitable solution.</p>	  
	    <p>Currently SSI is a widely discussed topic in the field of digital identity. In Switzerland the Public Sandbox Trust Infrastructure based on the SSI technology is currently being tested as the base for the national eID.</p>

		<p>We are glad to share that the paper «Data-Driven Governance in Crises: Topic Modelling for the Identification of Refugee Needs» was presented at the 24th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research by Kilian Sprenkamp.</p>

<p>Refugee management contemporarily mostly relies on top-down management approaches by governments. These often lead to suboptimal policies for refugees and highlight a need to better identify and integrate refugee needs into management.<br>
Kilian Sprenkamp, Liudmila Zavolokina, Mario Angst, Mateusz Dolata show that modern applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) allow for the effective analysis of large text corpora linked to refugee needs, making it possible to complement top-down approaches with bottom-up knowledge centered around the current needs of the refugee population. They developed and tested R2G – “Refugees to Government”, an application based on state-of-the-art topic modeling to identify refugee needs bottom-up through Telegram data. Thus, they contribute to the ongoing discourse on how to design refugee management applications and showcase how topic modeling can be utilized for data-driven governance during refugee crises.</p>

		<div class="grid-item grid_two_column dropdown_content add_padding expanded lauftext">To better orchestrate stakeholders in a crisis, it is essential to adopt a coordinated, holistic approach. First, clear communication channels must be established, enabling real-time information sharing. By facilitating this, all stakeholders have access to the same data, minimizing misunderstandings and improving decision-making. Second, clearly defined roles and responsibilities should be established to avoid confusion and duplication of efforts. This can be achieved through an initial meeting or conference where all stakeholders understand their tasks and the part they play in the larger operation. Lastly, regular check-ins and updates are crucial to keep everyone on the same page and adjust strategies if necessary. Utilizing digital platforms for these actions can drastically improve the orchestration of stakeholders.</div>

		<div class="grid-item grid_two_column dropdown_content add_padding lauftext">Government resilience during crises can be increased through several strategies. Firstly, the adoption of a 'Government as a Platform' model allows for better resource allocation and improved stakeholder collaboration. By leveraging digital platforms, governments can enhance their ability to respond to crises swiftly and effectively. Additionally, having a well-prepared crisis management plan that details response procedures and establishes clear roles and responsibilities can significantly enhance government resilience. Continuous training and simulations can ensure the government is ready to implement these plans when a crisis strikes. Finally, resilience also requires learning from past crises and continually refining response strategies based on these lessons.</div>

		<div class="grid-item grid_two_column dropdown_content add_padding expanded lauftext">
			Stakeholders need clear, consistent communication, access to real-time information, and the ability to collaborate effectively with other parties during a crisis. In addition, they need defined roles and responsibilities, as well as resources and support to fulfill those duties. Digital platforms can facilitate this by providing channels for communication and collaboration, resources for decision-making, and systems for tracking progress. Furthermore, emotional support and care for the well-being of stakeholders involved in managing the crisis can't be overlooked.

		<div class="grid-item grid_two_column dropdown_content add_padding lauftext">Different communication channels offer varied advantages and challenges, and learning from them can enhance crisis management. For instance, social media can provide real-time updates and public sentiment but may also spread misinformation. Traditional news outlets offer verified information but might not be as immediate or interactive. Direct communications, such as emails or messaging apps, provide a private channel for discussions but can become overwhelming with high volumes of information. Learning how to balance these channels – leveraging their strengths and mitigating their weaknesses – can lead to a more effective communication strategy in a crisis.</div>
